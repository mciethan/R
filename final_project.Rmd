# Predicting Property Values in South Lake Tahoe, CA
### AJ Murphy and Ethan McIntosh - CSCI 0100 Final Project - Fall 2021 

## Introduction
#### Home sales and property values are often studied using a "hedonic model" - i.e. thinking of the total property value of a home as the product of a vector of various attributes. In this general vein, we decided to use regression to evaluate various factors as possible predictors of property values in the small resort city of South Lake Tahoe, CA, for which parcel data is publicly available on the Tahoe Open Data website (https://data-trpa.opendata.arcgis.com/).   

``` {r import, echo = FALSE}
# blank values already removed
p <- read.csv("C://Users/emacl/Desktop/neighborhood_parcels.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis
#### First, we need to clean up the data, selecting the columns of the original dataset we're interested in analyzing, building the total property value column, and checking for 0's, blanks, or implausible values in important fields.  Then, we'll get a basic idea of the shape of the data using summary statistics as well as a histogram of property values.  Hypothesis: we expect property values to be skewed to the right.

``` {r datacleaning}
parcels <- select(p, "USECDPRICL", "USECDPRILI", "STRUCVAL", "LANDVAL", "YR_BUILT", "IMPR_SQ_FT", "NEAR_WTR", "FID_SLT_Neighborhoods")


# validate there aren't blank or 0 values in strucval and landval
count(parcels, (parcels$STRUCVAL == 0) | is.null(parcels$STRUCVAL))
count(parcels, (parcels$LANDVAL == 0) | is.null(parcels$LANDVAL))

# filter out any parcels with a year built earlier than 1500 (likely typos)
parcels <- filter(parcels, YR_BUILT >= 1500)


# build column for total property value
parcels$TOTVAL <- parcels$STRUCVAL + parcels$LANDVAL
res_parcels <- parcels %>% filter(USECDPRICL == "RES")

max(parcels$TOTVAL)
min(parcels$TOTVAL)
mean(parcels$TOTVAL)
median(parcels$TOTVAL)
ggplot(data = parcels, aes(x = TOTVAL)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 100000)
```

#### As expected, property values have a long right tail, with a median of $218,472 and a maximum of $23,757,998.  We decided to add a column to the table with log-transformed property values, since the shape of that distribution looks much more normal. 

``` {r}
parcels$log_TOTVAL <- (log(parcels$TOTVAL))
res_parcels$log_TOTVAL <- (log(res_parcels$TOTVAL))
ggplot(data = parcels, aes(x = log_TOTVAL)) + geom_histogram(bins = 50)
```

#### Finally, we want to examine our data in terms of building type categories.  The categories in this dataset include residential, commercial, industrial, manufacturing, and miscellaneous building categories, with various subcategories within each.  We want to see how similar their property value distributions are before we proceed.  Our hypothesis is that residential property values will look like a different distribution than commercial property values.

``` {r boxplots}
count(parcels, parcels$USECDPRICL != "RES")

ggplot(data = parcels, aes(x = USECDPRICL, y = log_TOTVAL)) + geom_boxplot()
```

#### Except for manufacturing, the other building types do have a visibly higher range of property values than residential buildings.  Non-residential building types only make up about 10% of this dataset, and we imagine that commercial property markets operate differently with regards to things like distance from the waterfront compared to residential property markets.  Therefore, we made a filtered table with just residential buildings (res_parcels) for the main portion of our analysis.

## Finding Best-Fitting Models for each Independent Variable

#### For our analysis, We are considering three independent variables: square footage, year built, and distance from the waterfront.  As a starting point, we want to test how correlated various fields in this dataset are with property values.  we hypothesize that square footage will be the most correlated with property values, followed by year built, then by proximity to the waterfront.  Additionally, we hypothesize that the shape of the relationship will be linear for square footage vs some kind of exponential decay for year built and waterfront distance.

``` {r corr}
cor(res_parcels$TOTVAL, res_parcels$IMPR_SQ_FT)
cor(res_parcels$TOTVAL, res_parcels$YR_BUILT)
cor(res_parcels$TOTVAL, res_parcels$NEAR_WTR)
cor(res_parcels$log_TOTVAL, res_parcels$IMPR_SQ_FT)
cor(res_parcels$log_TOTVAL, res_parcels$YR_BUILT)
cor(res_parcels$log_TOTVAL, res_parcels$NEAR_WTR)

pairs(res_parcels %>% select(IMPR_SQ_FT, YR_BUILT, NEAR_WTR, TOTVAL, log_TOTVAL))
```

#### The relative magnitudes of the correlation coefficients suggest that our hypothesis about the order of importance of square footage, year built, and distance to the waterfront was correct.  Furthermore, comparing the results in the transformed spaces vs non-transformed spaces, we see that the correlation coefficient didn't change much for square footage in the transformed space, and the point cloud in normal space looks pretty linear, confirming our original hypothesis that square footage would have a more or less linear relationship with property values.  For year built, the correlation coefficient was significantly higher when we plotted it against the log of property values, and that point cloud looks more linear than the one in normal space.  This confirms our hypothesis about year_built having more a curved (exponential or logarithmic) relationship with property values.  For distance to the waterfront, neither point cloud looks very linear (in particular, there is curve sharply upward at lower distances from the water, even in transformed space), so we have more work to do.

#### We wanted to see if we could model the relationship between distance to water and total property value via the use of lambda testing

``` {r lamda testing}
plot((res_parcels$NEAR_WTR),log(res_parcels$TOTVAL))

lamda <- c(-1,-.75,.5,-.25,.25,.5,.75,1)
lamda_plot <- function (lamda) {
  r2 <- numeric(0)
  for (i in lamda) {
  NEAR_WTR_lamda <- (res_parcels$TOTVAL^i)
lamda_model <- lm(NEAR_WTR_lamda~ res_parcels$NEAR_WTR)
r2 <- append(r2,summary(lamda_model)$r.squared)
}
print(r2)
plot(lamda,r2)
}
lamda_plot(lamda)
plot(res_parcels$TOTVAL^0.7 ~ res_parcels$NEAR_WTR)
```

#### After doing a series of lambdas and checking their r squared values, we find the best linear model based on the r squared value is likely to be around lambda = 0.7.  However, plotting this transformed space still yields a relatively non-linear looking point cloud.  We speculate that this may be because the function is in fact not logarithic or exponetial, disconfirming our original hypothesis about this variable. Perhaps this is the case because the relationship between waterfront distance and property values is actually multiple distributions on top of each other.  One possible way to determine this is by looking at this relationship on a smaller (neighborhood) scale.  

![Neighborhoods Map](images/Neighborhoods.png)



#### This map was created in ArcGIS Pro based on this parcel dataset, with darker purple polygons representing parcels with higher property values per square foot, and the orange boundary lines delineating neighborhoods of South Lake Tahoe, numbered 1-8.  Visually, one can notice steeper gradients of purple in neighborhoods closer to the waterfront.  The neighborhood values are stored in res_parcels under the FID_SLT_Neighborhoods column.  We tried doing neighborhood-level analyses for neighborhoods 1, 5, and 6, located along the waterfront, as well as all other neighborhoods.  

``` {r neighborhoods}
n1 <- res_parcels %>% filter(FID_SLT_Neighborhoods == 1)
n5 <- res_parcels %>% filter(FID_SLT_Neighborhoods == 5)
n6 <- res_parcels %>% filter(FID_SLT_Neighborhoods == 6)
all_others <- res_parcels %>% filter(FID_SLT_Neighborhoods %in% c(2,3,4,7,8))

cor(n1$log_TOTVAL, n1$NEAR_WTR)
cor(n5$log_TOTVAL, n5$NEAR_WTR)
cor(n6$log_TOTVAL, n6$NEAR_WTR)
cor(all_others$log_TOTVAL, all_others$NEAR_WTR)

plot(n1$log_TOTVAL ~ n1$NEAR_WTR)
plot(n5$log_TOTVAL ~ n5$NEAR_WTR)
plot(n6$log_TOTVAL ~ n6$NEAR_WTR)
plot(all_others$log_TOTVAL ~ all_others$NEAR_WTR)
```

#### The correlation coefficients were much stronger for neighborhoods 1 and 6 than for neighborhood 5 or for the non-waterfront neighborhoods.  Furthermore, the neighborhood specific point clouds look much more linear than the point cloud for the whole dataset.  To model the waterfront proximity variable going forward, we will use these smaller-scale distributions.  Our original hypothesis was that waterfront proximity might be a single logarithmic decay type model, so this neighborhood level analysis helped us refine that.

## Running and Evaluating the Models

#### Now that we have and idea of which spaces are likely to produce the best fitting models for square footage, year built, and waterfront proximity, we went ahead and created linear models for each variable.  To plot these models, we used a filtered version of the table (property value < $10,000,000) to have graphs with better visibility of the main bulk of the point cloud in relation to the models.  These values were still part of the models, just not graphed.
```{r linear modeling}
## Since we hypothesized that total value and square feet resulted in a linear relationship, we decided to do a linear model of both of them.
lm_Sq_Ft <- lm(res_parcels$TOTVAL ~ res_parcels$IMPR_SQ_FT)
summary(lm_Sq_Ft)

## Since we hypothesized that total value and year built would result in a curved model, so we decided to do the log of Total value by the year built.
lm_Yr_Built <- lm(log(res_parcels$TOTVAL) ~ res_parcels$YR_BUILT)
summary(lm_Yr_Built)

## Since we found that the relationship between total value and NEAR_WTR might be best understood by breaking it into multiple distributions, we did linear models for different neighborhood groups with the log of total value on the y.
lm_all_parcels <- lm(res_parcels$log_TOTVAL ~ res_parcels$NEAR_WTR)
lm_n1 <- lm(n1$log_TOTVAL ~ n1$NEAR_WTR)
lm_n5 <- lm(n5$log_TOTVAL ~ n5$NEAR_WTR)
lm_n6 <- lm(n6$log_TOTVAL ~ n6$NEAR_WTR)
lm_others <- lm(all_others$log_TOTVAL ~ all_others$NEAR_WTR)

summary(lm_all_parcels)
summary(lm_n1)
summary(lm_n5)
summary(lm_n6)
summary(lm_others)
```

#### We found that the r.squared value for the linear model of TOTVAL and IMPR_SQ_FT is equal to .388 and the p-value equal to 2.2 * 10^-16. We found that the r.squared value for the linear model of log(TOTVAL) and YR_BUILT is equal to .2137 and the p-value equal to 2.2 * 10^-16.  For our linear models of log(TOTVAL) vs NEAR_WTR, we found an r squared of 0.12 for neighborhood 6, 0.06 for neighborhood 1, and near 0 for neighborhood 5 as well as the rest of the neighborhoods, with a high degree of significance.The fact that square footage had a bigger r squared than year built, which had a bigger r squared than any of the neighborhoods did for waterfront distance, confirms our original hypothesis about the relative strength of these three variables

#### An important thing to note is that while we treated these variables as independent to evaluate their relative strengths, in real life, they are not completely independent variables.  For example, we found that year built is actually somewhat correlated with square footage.  The other variables are also slightly correlated with each other, but less so.  

``` {r dependence}
cor(res_parcels$IMPR_SQ_FT, res_parcels$YR_BUILT)
cor(res_parcels$IMPR_SQ_FT, res_parcels$NEAR_WTR)
cor(res_parcels$YR_BUILT, res_parcels$NEAR_WTR)
```

#### We hypothesize that this correlation between year built and square footage may have to do with newer buildings being bigger on average.  We're not sure what the sources of correlation between the other variables are, but all this means is that these r squared numbers should not be interpreted as meaning that 39% of property value comes from square footage, 21% from year built, etc.  Instead, we are just using them to roughly evaluate how strong each variable is compared to the others

#### To more rigorously evaluate how well these models did, we first decided to plot them over our original scatterplots.  

``` {r modelplots}

plot_curve <- function(x, y, a, b) {
  plot(x, y)
  curve(exp(a + b * x), col = "red", add = TRUE)
}

res_parcels_f <- res_parcels %>% filter(TOTVAL < 10000000)
n6_f <- n6 %>% filter(TOTVAL < 10000000)

## Plotting the linear model of total property value vs square feet
plot(res_parcels_f$TOTVAL ~ res_parcels_f$IMPR_SQ_FT) 
abline(lm_Sq_Ft, col="red")

# Plotting the exponential model of total property value vs. year built
plot_curve(res_parcels_f$YR_BUILT, res_parcels_f$TOTVAL, lm_Yr_Built$coefficients[1], lm_Yr_Built$coefficients[2])

# plotting the models for each neighborhood
plot_curve(n1$NEAR_WTR, n1$TOTVAL, lm_n1$coefficients[1], lm_n1$coefficients[2])
plot_curve(n5$NEAR_WTR, n5$TOTVAL, lm_n5$coefficients[1], lm_n5$coefficients[2])
plot_curve(n6_f$NEAR_WTR, n6_f$TOTVAL, lm_n6$coefficients[1], lm_n6$coefficients[2])
plot_curve(all_others$NEAR_WTR, all_others$TOTVAL, lm_others$coefficients[1], lm_others$coefficients[2])
```

#### Visually, the models for square footage and year built look like good fits.  The models for waterfront distance look okay for most of the distribution, but with some set of outliers on the high end near the waterfront.  Specifically, we noticed that in each of the waterfront neighborhoods (1, 5, and 6). the range of property values very close to the waterfront is much wider than in the rest of the distribution.  However, in neighborhood 5, the upper property values only go up to around $1,000,000, while they go much higher for neighborhoods 1 and 6.  

``` {r residuals}
plot(lm_Sq_Ft, which = 1)
plot(lm_Yr_Built, which = 1)
plot(lm_n1, which = 1)
plot(lm_n5, which = 1)
plot(lm_n6, which = 1)
plot(lm_others, which = 1)
```

#### If we were to discount outliers, most of these residual plots seem fairly cloudlike.  The residuals for neighborhood 6 have more of a structure, so results for this neighborhood should be taken with more of a grain of salt.  Neighborhood 6 has the fewest data points, so it makes sense that the model wouldn't account for as much of the hyperlocal variation present on that smaller scale.

## Conclusion

#### These regression models confirm most of our original hypotheses.  We found that of the three variables we considered, that square footage was the strongest predictor of property values in South Lake Tahoe, and could be modeled linearly in untransformed space.  We also confirmed that year built was the second strongest predictor of property values, and that its best fitting model was more of a curve.  For waterfront distance, we had originally predicted a curved relationship as well, but found after log transformation and lambda testing that in fact, this variable was best considered on a more local scale than the entire dataset.

#### We were curious as to why some waterfront neighborhoods (1, 6) had a stronger relationship between coast proximity and property values than others (5).  After doing some internet digging, we found that the two neighborhoods with relatively high r squared values happen to be waterfront neighborhoods with private beaches, which could be one explanation for these local differences, or could just be an interesting coincidence.  The below map shows the r squared values for each area in boxes, along with screenshots from property development websites showing the public vs private nature of beaches in those areas.
